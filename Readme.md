# Playground Android

This repo is what it actually says. Its a personal app that I use to try out native Android features and experiment with them.

Everytime a new feature is released or I wanted to experiment with something, I always lost motivation by the time I had set up the project, architecture and integrate other basic libraries to make the app run in an accpetable state.
