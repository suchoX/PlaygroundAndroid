# Playground Android

This repo is what it actually says. Its a personal app that I use to try out native Android features and experiment with them.

Everytime a new feature is released or I wanted to experiement with something, I always lost motivation by the time I had set up the project, architecture and integrate other basic libraries to make the app run in an accpetable state.

## Features as of now

### Architecture
- Clean Architecture
- Single Activity with AndroidX Navigation
- Hilt for Dependency Injection
- 

### Design
- Dark Mode with MaterialComponents.DayNight
- ConstraintLayout
- Downloadable Fonts

This app will evolve with time, but will never be a specific feature driven. It will be a mixture of features that makes no sense with together (Imagine Notes app with Cat pictures and Chuck Norris Jokes) but will showcase the Android features
